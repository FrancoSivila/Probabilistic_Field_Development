# Probabilistic_Field_Development
Probabilistic Field Development (Crystal Ball MS Excel)
MS Excel workbook (WB) with VBA to model field development (low permeability/unconventional reservoirs) assumes no interference between wells.
Well production from Arp Decline curve. Working to add a section to calculate Qi for fractured wells.
The WB can model:
  Up to 100 wells but it can be modified changing the matrix on sheet "Well Prod".
  CAPEX for well, line, etc.
  Number of wells
  Oil/gas prices

The WB used Crytal Ball (Oracle) for probabilistic calcs.
VBA can import and update data generated on Crystal Ball.
